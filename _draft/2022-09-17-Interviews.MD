Just did the amazon online assessment part 1 for software development engineer, the questions where not too hard, but the persure to complete them is high, since this was my first online assessment in months and after sending out hundreds of applications.
I have not been praticing my coding skills at all in the last few months, kind of lost hope in getting to see a interviewer's face and also mainly due to burn out from programming, after my last year in colloge; But after starting this website I have gained a renewed sense of purpose and interest in programming, just doing questins and problem sovling is not very fun for me, using those skill to create something is what's fun for me, I have somehow lost sight of that during my last two years in college, might be due to the pandemic or working on things I don't care about, anyway with this renewed sense of motivation, I'll brush up on my skills, finish cracking the coding interview and do more leetcode medium quetions.

Something interesting came up when studying for these tests, prefix trees or tries, I don't remember coming across this concept during my course in college so it is a interesting concept, I have always wondered since learning about binary trees, what trees with more then two branches will function, but usally these Ideas get cut short, with the main answer from my inner self saying, off course there is mo algorithm with more branches, it will just simply be less effeienct while being more complex.
