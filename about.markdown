Hi I am a software Eningeer this is a website where I can experiment with some projects and showcase them.

My main programming languages are Python and Java.

I am learning Frontend for this website but I have worked with frontend tech before this, so this is more of an imporving my skils website.
So far this website just uses javascript and runs on the Jekyll, I am integrating pyscript and many other things that I find interesting into the website.

My main interests in the tech space will be Machine Learning.

My hobby is digital Art but I am no good at it -{some Art links here}- . -->
