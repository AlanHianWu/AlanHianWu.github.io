##### Sep 10 2022
So first things first, got to learn GLSL;

<!-- I did a module in colloge about computer graphics, unfortunatly the professor that thought there for years retired during the pandenmic, so in turn we got a new subsitute that didn't really thought us what we expected, the labs where multiple choice questions that turned out to be exams, the notes where jsut poorly copy and pasted text slides from an graphics book etc... was not fun, but since nearly all of us where there to just get a good grade; word was that the old professor did lots of labs with pratical work where you end up programming with the graphics concepts, students will usally get very good grades; I having caught the virus and having other problems related to that situation at the time, promptly tuned out all the drama and course work going into a nearly zombie like state for the remainder of that time. Which is an appoarch to stress I can whole heartly not recommend; thinking back at the start of it all, when I was of sound mind, I so eagerly joined in on the course for pure passion alone, I did not follow the tales of my peers and choose my modeuls like them, with abhorrent strategy, min maxing to achieve the easiest high grade, looking back now I was too stubborn.

So now after all that, I can come back, here, and do what I have always done, study it myself at my pace, and make those projects myself with my standards-->
