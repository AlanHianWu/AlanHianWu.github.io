# Updates On This Project 
---

##### Sep 10 2022 

Working on inputs today, been just using editable=true on the divs so it can take text, but I don't have that much control over the process, and I like using tabs for typing, but with the browser it will read the tab input and skip to the next part, this goes for all keyboard shortcuts so far, so the Idea is to disable keyboard shortcuts on the editor itself and make them myself.

implementing this will be great since I can upgrade the terminal next.

Looking through online, every project seems to be using a premade package called code mirror to achieve the text editor part,
it's always best to not reinvent the wheel, but i perfer to create this myself this time exspeically just for the first time.

Found out you can just enable editable text in the tags, so now all I need to worry about is syntax highlight

I fixed up some issues I found around the site, now I had a look at codepen, hackerRank and google docs, looks like they all use the many divs plus javascript solution, but google docs uses a kanvas element, I'll have to learn about the kanvas tag if I want to go with that opttion. I might just start with the divs options first since my terminal is made that way.

trying out a new format to log project development here,

so I always wanted to make a webIDE, this mainly stemed from praticing coding promblems in college and online with websites such as hackerrank and leetcode.

So far I am at a lost to how to tackle this project, by the looks of it I'll need alot of javascript and some API's to link it to the backend where I can run a server to actually test the code. but this is just a static site and I don't want to pay for a server as of right now. So my plan is to some how spin up a local server instance on the client side with some tech out there, so I can call on that instead.

I'll have to think about the backend later first things first, gonna build the UI first, in college we would first draw up UMLs and specs first, but since this my just my website I'll just start by throwing stuff to the wall and see what sticks (naming just for UI design and what tech to use)
