There are only two project I have done so far that used NLP

| Project | Link | GoogleColab |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Political Bias detector | [My Political Bias detector](https://github.com/AlanHianWu/political_bias_ML) | [Colab Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12IewIqHowq_dpUqLS7eUrBK6YkdH2KoU?usp=sharing)
| Conversation Analysis | [Conversation Analysis project](https://github.com/AlanHianWu/Meeting-conversation_analysis) | 

Both these projects where done on University gitlab accounts and have no front-end, my plans are to polish these and bring them live here.

For the Political Bias detector, I used BERT and trained it with news articles collected with Python.

The conversation analysis uses Dbpedia spotlight's built in NLP to process and get key word terms out of a conversation, I also used deepspeech for audio processing.
