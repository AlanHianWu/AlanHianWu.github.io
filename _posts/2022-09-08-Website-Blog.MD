# Updates On This Project

##### Sep 9 2022
Bit of a slow start today

##### Sep 8 2022

This website use's jekyll, I was thinking of using other things like Reactjs, vuejs etc. but since everything was already set up on github and I have very little experience working on UI design and frontend stuff I ended up working with jekyll.

but since all jekyll does is manage the files, I am free to do what ever I want which is how I expected most every other web frame work preforms just layers and layers of convience stacked on top of the core tech of HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT plus some SQL, but since I have only worked with pure javascript, html, css and some bits of vuejs and reactjs from colloge I can't really give a difinative answer.

So far I am not very happy with how the website looks, so I'll be working on it constantly, some things I'll have to do, like search bars, nav bars, and more animations so far there isn't much stuff on here for nav and search so I'll leave that on the back burner for now, but man I'll have the brain strom some more on the look.

I'll need to work on the dark mode some more aswell sincce right now all it does is invert the colours of the background and text, should be simple enough just add more css.

I am still set on making the web terminal the center piece of the web site but stuck on how it will look
