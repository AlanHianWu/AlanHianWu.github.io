was thinking, build terminal to browse through all the ptojects


I'll like to do some documenting on this project:
[Link](https://dev.to/saisandeepvaddi/how-to-create-web-based-terminals-38d) this article seems to be very informative so I'll follow through on it for now, before this [This](https://itnext.io/how-to-create-interactive-terminal-like-website-888bb0972288) is where I started.

I don't really like how all the hard/fun bits of the project is all pre-built already, so I plan on study some more and try to build the ternmial from scatch.
